# bugs:
- signup is not smooth all the time


# to add:

- sign msgs
- where to hold private / public keys (***most important*** easy to install for the end user)
 - show private key only once
- conversation req
- delete account
- delete msgs

- a stats page about all the users of site
- export keys to files
- make the keys with gpg
- show an indicator when a chat has new msgs
- notif system
- add unread msgs (?)

# done:
- get contacts when users logs in 
- add modal
- search up user id instead of adding public key manually
